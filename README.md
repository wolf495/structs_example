# structs_example
These files are samples showcasing how I can create structs of objects in C, and then
manipulate these structs by rearranging the objects.
run the command './run' to print back the objects from the struct that were created in the main file. 
executable run requires exec permission. use 'chmod +x run'.
List is ordered by highest number.
